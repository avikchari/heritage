"important avoid using commas  use vertical slash ""|"" if you need comma  because i cannot separate out the data properly",,,
*you can export this as a csv for Unity to read in this data and load the respective file accordingly if the assets are in the respective folders,,,
*the top row will be ignored game starts with menu then school then adult for example,,,
*row arrangement can be in any order but not column,,,
*blank is also and option for no file usage,,,
*prefer not to use this for loading visual assets in a scene needs to be inspected directly through unity itself because of placement position,,,
Narration is dialogue display has no timer but its after any event that is customized in a scene,,,
all inputs here are file names except narration,,,
